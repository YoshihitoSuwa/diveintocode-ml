segmentation problems:\n","    - Some of architectures can be easily adapted to the problem (ie ResNet)\n","    - Other architectures may require more experimentation with selection of proper layers for feature extraction and padding (example of using [Xception](https://www.kaggle.com/meaninglesslives/getting-0-87-on-private-lb-using-kaggle-kernel). )\n","    - You can experiment with selection of layers for feature extraction\n","    - For some models, you can also try to experiment with number of encoder/decoder blocks\n","- Threshold optimization is important in problems, where direct metric optimization during training is difficult.\n","    - It it possible to use more involved optimization methods (from [scipy optimize](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html)), although this may not be optimal unless distribution of train and test set are very similar. Overoptimization of threshold or any other parameter on validation set may result in worse test set results.\n","- Experiment with various losses - BCE, Dice, combined BCE with Dice, Lovash loss.\n","    - Models trained with various losses may give different results, which may be advantageous when ensembling.\n","\n","\n","### Possible experiments:\n","\n","- Change type of decoder block in created segmentation model\n","- Create your own decoder blocks\n","- Train with other losses\n","- Train longer\n","- Train with BCE/Dice, save the model, then load weights and finetune with Lovash
